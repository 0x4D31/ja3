# JA3 - A new way to profile SSL Clients

JA3 is a new technique for creating SSL client fingerprints that are easy to produce and can be easily shared for threat intelligence.

A list of over 400 JA3's and their associated applications can be found [here](https://github.com/trisulnsm/trisul-scripts/tree/master/lua/frontend_scripts/reassembly/ja3/prints)

Work on a JA3 Malware Blacklist is in progress.

## Examples

JA3 fingerprint for the standard Tor client:  
```
e7d705a3286e19ea42f587b344ee6865
```
JA3 fingerprint for the Dyre malware family:
```
55fa82b61806d2e6e9848260de2ecb34
```
While destination IPs, Ports, and X509 certificates change, the JA3 fingerprint remains constant for the client application in these examples.

## How it works

TLS and it’s predecessor, SSL, I will refer to both as “SSL” for simplicity, are used to encrypt communication for both common applications, to keep your data secure, and malware, so it can hide in the noise. To initiate a SSL session, a client will send a SSL Client Hello packet following the TCP 3-way handshake. This packet and the way in which it is generated is dependant on packages and methods used when building the client application. The server, if accepting SSL connections, will respond with a SSL Server Hello packet, thus continuing the cryptographic negotiation. Because SSL negotiations are transmitted in the clear, it’s possible to fingerprint and identify client applications using the details in the SSL Client Hello packet.

JA3 gathers the decimal values of the bytes for the following fields in the Client Hello packet; SSL Version, Accepted Ciphers, List of Extensions, Elliptic Curves, and Elliptic Curve Formats. It then concatenates those values together in order, using a "," to delimit each field and a "-" to delimit each value in each field.

The field order is as follows:
```
SSLVersion,Cipher,SSLExtension,EllipticCurve,EllipticCurvePointFormat
```
Example:
```    
769,47-53-5-10-49161-49162-49171-49172-50-56-19-4,0-10-11,23-24-25,0
```
If there are no SSL Extensions in the Client Hello, the fields are left empty. 

Example:
```   
769,4-5-10-9-100-98-3-6-19-18-99,,,
```
These strings are then MD5 hashed to produce an easily consumable and sharable 32 character fingerprint. This is the JA3 SSL Client Fingerprint.
```
769,47-53-5-10-49161-49162-49171-49172-50-56-19-4,0-10-11,23-24-25,0 --> ada70206e40642a3e4461f35503241d5
769,4-5-10-9-100-98-3-6-19-18-99,,, --> de350869b8c85de67a350c8d186f11e6
```
We have support for Bro and Python. Suricata and others are in the works!
