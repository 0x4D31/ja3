# JA3 - A new way to profile SSL Clients


JA3 is a new technique for creating SSL client fingerprints that are easy to produce and can be easily shared for threat intelligence.

## Examples

JA3 fingerprint for the standard Tor client:  
```
e7d705a3286e19ea42f587b344ee6865
```
JA3 fingerprint for the Dyre malware family:
```
55fa82b61806d2e6e9848260de2ecb34
```
While destination IPs, Ports, and X509 certificates change, the JA3 fingerprint remains constant for the client application in these examples.

## How it works

JA3 takes the decimal values of the bytes for certain fields (version, ciphers, extensions, etc.) in the SSL Client Hello packet and concatenates them together, in a particular order, using a "," to delimit each field and a "-" to delimit each value in each field. 

The field order is as follows:
```
SSLVersion,Cipher,SSLExtension,EllipticCurve,EllipticCurvePointFormat
```
Example:
    
    769,47-53-5-10-49161-49162-49171-49172-50-56-19-4,0-10-11,23-24-25,0

If there are no SSL Extensions in the Client Hello, the fields are left empty. 

Example:
    
    769,4-5-10-9-100-98-3-6-19-18-99,,,

These strings are then MD5 hashed to produce an easily consumable and sharable 32 character fingerprint. This is the JA3 SSL Client Fingerprint.

    769,47-53-5-10-49161-49162-49171-49172-50-56-19-4,0-10-11,23-24-25,0 --> ada70206e40642a3e4461f35503241d5
